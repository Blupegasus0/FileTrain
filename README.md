### FileTrain

File Train is a program designed to allow the encryption and transfer of files and shell commands between two computers on a LAN.


### Purpose

The goal of this FileTrain is to allow its developers to gain experience in creating a production level product. Additionally it is used to teach the basics of the Transport Layer Protocol (TCP), Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD), and the Rust Language.

All of this will result in a simple application used to share files and other data, securely, over a network.


### Policies

FileTrain:

+ Uses Password Encryption to secure data
+ Transfers data using TCP
+ Can be used with or without the GUI
